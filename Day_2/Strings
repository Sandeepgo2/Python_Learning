Python strings are sequences of characters, and they play a fundamental role in Python programming. They are versatile data types used for representing and manipulating textual data. Here are some key features and applications of Python strings:

Text Processing: Python strings are primarily used for text processing. You can store and manipulate textual data such as names, sentences, paragraphs, and more.

String Creation: You can create strings in Python by enclosing text in single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes. For example:

```single_quoted = 'This is a single-quoted string.'
double_quoted = "This is a double-quoted string."
triple_quoted = '''This is a triple-quoted string.'''

Concatenation: You can concatenate strings using the '+' operator.
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
